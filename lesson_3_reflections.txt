When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working with others in a team.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are used to clone other repros on github. This allows you to change the content without effecting the orginial repro, a reference is added. Clone is used to clone repros so you can add changes etc... Branches are used to add features and bug fixes without effecting the master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You are able to fast forward merge your changes by moving the label.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Using beyond compare, local and shared files. Backup files diff'ed. Much harder and not as simple to review changes

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

When you want to try something new and not effect the master
